## Project Summary
Project target is to design a platform that focuses on Pokémon card selling and P2P trading. Our system can be mainly divided into two functional modules. These two parts are that the platform sells Pokémon card blind boxes to users and users trade Pokémon cards to each other. For the first part, the platform will not sell a specific card but in the form of a blind box. Users who purchase a blind box will randomly get cards within a fixed range of pokemon cards. After getting the card, users can choose to mail the card or resell the card they don't like directly on the website. Or if they want, they can directly buy a single card resold by other users instead of buying the blind boxes sold by the platform.
